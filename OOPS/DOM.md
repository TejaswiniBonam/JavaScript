# DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a webpage dynamically using programming languages like JavaScript.

* For example:
* - Access and modify HTML elements.
* - Change CSS styles dynamically.
* - Respond to user events like clicks or keypresses.

The DOM is an essential part of web development, enabling interactive and dynamic web applications.


* DOM is another built-in Object of Javascript
