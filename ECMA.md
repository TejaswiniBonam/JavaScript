# ECMAScript

**ECMAScript** is a standardized scripting language specification, primarily used as the foundation for JavaScript. It defines the core features, syntax, and semantics of the language, ensuring interoperability across different implementations and platforms. The standard is maintained by ECMA International, with regular updates introducing new features and improvements.

- **JavaScript** is the most well-known implementation of ECMAScript.
- Other implementations include JScript and ActionScript.

## Key Points

- ECMAScript standardizes language features like variables, functions, objects, and control structures.
- New versions (ES5, ES6/ES2015, etc.) add features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions.
- Ensures consistent behavior of scripts across browsers and environments.

For more details, see the [ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/).

## JavaScript Standards Evolution

JavaScript has followed the ECMAScript standard since its early days. The first edition of ECMAScript was published in 1997 to formalize the language and ensure compatibility across browsers.

### Major ECMAScript Editions

- **ES1 (1997):** Initial standardization of JavaScript.
- **ES3 (1999):** Added regular expressions, better string handling, and error handling.
- **ES5 (2009):** Introduced strict mode, JSON support, and improved object manipulation.
- **ES6/ES2015 (2015):** Major update with classes, modules, arrow functions, promises, `let`/`const`, and more.
- **ES2016+ (Yearly updates):** Smaller, incremental improvements such as `Array.prototype.includes`, async/await, and new data structures.

JavaScript continues to evolve with annual ECMAScript updates, ensuring modern features and consistent behavior across platforms.
