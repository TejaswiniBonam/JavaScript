# ECMAScript

**ECMAScript** is a standardized scripting language specification, primarily used as the foundation for JavaScript. It defines the core features, syntax, and semantics of the language, ensuring interoperability across different implementations and platforms. The standard is maintained by ECMA International, with regular updates introducing new features and improvements.

- **JavaScript** is the most well-known implementation of ECMAScript.
- Other implementations include JScript and ActionScript.

## Key Points

- ECMAScript standardizes language features like variables, functions, objects, and control structures.
- New versions (ES5, ES6/ES2015, etc.) add features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions.
- Ensures consistent behavior of scripts across browsers and environments.
